Tony Lopez Biography American TikTok Star, who is also a member of the Lopez Brothers along with his brother Ondreaz Lopez. His tonylopez TikTok page has more than 22 million

<p>According to The TikTok Shaderoom, Tony used Snapchat and Instagram direct messages to communicate with minors. “I guess it never clicked into his head that I wasn’t 20 years old,” the victim said, commenting on screenshots of Snapchat messages that were allegedly sent to him by a Hype House member. “But you can see, he kept saying s–t knowing I wasn’t old. Predators don’t care!”</p>
<p>Tony was accused of taking @ouuitzjaidaa’s dance, without crediting her. These accusations, while not as serious as sending sexual messages directly to minors, are damaging to Tony’s credibility and reputation as a content creator.</p>
